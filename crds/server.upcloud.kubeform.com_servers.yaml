                      idea behind simple backups is to provide a simplified way of
                      backing up *all* of the storages attached to a given server.
                      \t\t\t\tThis means you cannot have simple backup set for a server,

                      templates. \t\t\t\tAlso, due to how UpCloud API works with simple
                      backups and how Terraform orders the update operations, \t\t\t\tit
